This year we’re kickstarting our new social enterprise,&nbsp;[Vumwe Designs](https://empowertz.org/news/2021/03/05/were-kickstarting-our-social-enterprise/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}\! In working with 99 gender-based violence survivors-turned-entrepreneurs, we are constantly inspired. Below you'll meet one of our artisans, Safina Shabani, who agreed to let us share a bit about her.

**Safina Shabani, mom of four, is the chairperson of the group of women from the village of Makanya. She is a strong leader and is skilled at both batik and tie-dye. Director of Vumwe Designs, Catherine Wales, was able to ask her a few questions in preparation for Empower Tanzania’s Mother’s Day campaign in which we’re hoping to raise $15,000 to kickstart this social enterprise:**

***Catherine: What special skills do you bring to Vumwe Designs?&nbsp;***

Safina: I am the chairperson of our group, the mediator of emerging challenges in the group, and the protector of our unity.

***C: How has your work with Vumwe Designs improved your life?***

S: When I was young, I always dreamed of a good education and a better life. Since my work with Vumwe, I have been able to realize some of my dreams. I have been able to send my last born to school. I am also able to provide for my family’s basic needs. And I’m building a house\! In addition to that, I have used my earnings from Vumwe as capital for another small business. This will help me to earn extra income and improve my life further. I also have hope for a better life for my children. They maybe can even build their own modern home someday\!

***C: What have you learned during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic?***

S: I have learned to avoid unnecessary or large gatherings and I have learned the importance of taking care of myself and my family. My health is important and I need to take care\!&nbsp; I also have learned more about money, like how important it is to save and make good use of the money I have. It’s important to be prepared for times when I’m not able to work.

***C: What beauty do you find in life?***

&nbsp;

S: I find great joy and beauty in my friendships.

***C: How would your best friend describe you?***&nbsp;

&nbsp;

S: Strong and confident.

***C: What do your four children think of your work with Vumwe?***

S: My children love what I do because it has helped in improving our lives and it helps to get income for different activities such as agriculture activities.

***C: What do you like to do with your kids?***

S: We love talking together as a family. We love to share ideas and we make decisions together. I have fun with my kids, especially during the holidays\!
