On November 11th, 500 people&nbsp; gathered in downtown Davenport for the 9th annual Water Party, an event that for the third year in a row has benefited Empower Tanzania water projects. It was an incredible night of music, wine, beer, an whiskey tasting, small bites by a favorite local chef, music, and friends. Partygoers bought raffle tickets, tried their hand on the wine pull, shopped for Tanzanian jewelry, and bid on silent auction items and art. Through their incredible generosity, Water Party 2018 raised over $58,000 for clean water in Tanzania!!! Our efforts will focus on the village of Njiro. We are so thankful to all who made the party happen, attended the event, and donated so generously!

We could not be more grateful for the group of incredible volunteers that made the night happen. They transformed the space from an empty warehouse to a beautiful and sophisticated scene.

Guests enjoyed local beer tasting, wine tasting, whiskey tasting, small bites by Cushman Food & Engine, and the musical stylings of DJ Kung Fu Kitty.

Partygoers also enjoyed a selfie station, a "water walk" (in which they could lift heavy jerry cans filled with water), and the chance to bid generously on gorgeous art and remarkable silent auction baskets. Jewelry handmade in Tanzania was also sold at the event.

In the middle of the party, event organizers thanked guests for using their good time for a good cause and cast a vision for Empower Tanzania's next project in the village of Njiro.&nbsp;

We could not be more thankful to be associated with this group of Eastern Iowa water advocates. Over the last nine years, The Water Party has transformed the lives of over 140,000 people around the globe. The generosity of the Quad City community has enabled over 100 entrepreneurs and their families to thrive and has funded the construction or rehabilitation of wells in twelve villages in desperately poor areas of Liberia, Uganda, India, and Tanzania. &nbsp;Because of this annual event, families are moving out of poverty, women and children are no longer spending hours each day laboring to gather dirty water from rivers and swamps, and entire communities have access to clean and safe water - for good! A special thanks to all of the generous sponsor who have entrusted Empower Tanzania with their gifts: Blue Bench Design, Petersen Plumbing & Heating, WVIK, One Step Printing, Cushman Food & Engine, The Ruby Slipper, Katsch, Design Build by Architects, Iowa American Water, Doland Jewelers, Locals Love Us, Me & Billy, Fastbreak Logistics, coworkqc. &nbsp;
