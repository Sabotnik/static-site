![](/uploads/2016/04/27/5-reasons-to-join-the-wezesha-circle/1-1.jpg)We recently launched our monthly giving program and want to invite YOU to consider being a part of the Wezesha Circle. There are thousands of reasons to engage at this level, and we've listed a handful here:

1. ACCESS TO THE INSIDE SCOOP—Executive director of Empower Tanzania, Phil Latessa, recently wrote an entertaining and thoughtful book entitled Surviving Vodka Toasts & Rampaging Elephants. By signing up for the Wezesha Circle, you'll get special updates from Phil that will, much like his book, entertain and inform. You will be the first to know about organization events and project updates, and you'll have access to our staff and volunteers, all of &nbsp;whom will gladly share experiences and answer questions.

2. GIVING FEELS GOOD— Gandhi once said that "the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in service of others." This wisdom rings true for people volunteering time, but those donating money also reap psychological benefits. Several studies show that people report feeling physically healthier, &nbsp;an improved sense of well-being, and lowered stress levels when they actively give to others.

3. CLAIM YOUR TAX DEDUCTION—A gift to a qualified charitable organization such as Empower Tanzania entitles you to a charitable contribution against your income tax if you itemize deductions. The actual cost of the donation is reduced by your tax savings and everyone wins!

4. BE A PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF—Reallocating your resources each month in order to give to programs that help lift men and women from extreme poverty in rural Tanzania widens the world you occupy. It's remarkable what a small gift from an American can do in a developing nation. And we benefit, too! When we're less interested in ourselves and more interested in the world around us, our minds are opened to new ideas and new joys.

5. KIDS LIKE ANDREA GODSON WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITIES ONCE CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE—Because of generous American donors, each Saturday Andrea can be found at the Mraamba Kids Club. There, he and 49 other children enjoy two nutritious meals and the support needed to attend and succeed in school. A $50 donation is all Andrea needs to totally change the course of his life! In 2015, Empower Tanzania replicated this program model and opened the Msindo Kids Club with 50 students. Our loyal donors make a beautiful change in this world! &nbsp;
