title: Ndatu Water Supply
categories: [health]

In the village of Ndatu, just outside of Arusha, Tanzania, the Uraki School serving 1,300 primary school children, needs a new water supply. Their current source of water is a river, badly contaminated with bacteria.

This water project will collect water from a natural spring 7 km up hill from the school and pipe it downhill to the school and surrounding community. The system will allow for treatment of the water, which will eliminate the bacteria and reduce the levels of fluoride to a safe amount.containing high levels of fluoride.

This is a cooperative project between Empower Tanzania and Summit4water, a group of four philanthropists from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Beijing, China, who are raising the funds and working with local engineers to design the project.
