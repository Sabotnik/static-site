During the past year, the PEPFAR-funded **Palliative Care Project** added seven new sites which were transferred from another NGO and will add three new sites in the Mwanga District soon. Each of these sites will have a team of 10 people who deliver end of life care to terminally ill HIV/AIDS patients.

These Community Health Workers are supervised by a nurse at the nearby health facility. These Nurse Supervisors are participating in training programs to improve their clinical and management skills.

Nurse Supervisors receive training on a variety of subjects during a recent visit by ETI board members and volunteers. They are also receiving regular training from local educators.

Project staff have developed strong working relationships with government officials in both the Same and Mwanga Districts to avoid duplication and assure maximum benefit of all the health programs in the area. An ETI delegation meeting with the Same District Commissioner on a recent visit to update him on our activity in the area, and seek support. Close communication with local government officials is key to success.
