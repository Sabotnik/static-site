People often ask how we at ETI get so much done with such a small staff, and the answer is simple.

<strong>VOLUNTEERS!</strong>

We believe firmly that most people really want to <em>"do good"</em> with their lives, and are compassionate. Â They would love to be part of something bigger than themselves that makes a significant positive impact on the world.....BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW.

Our work gets done because we have an ARMY of volunteers who have found ways to use their talents to help the cause, and when we all pool our resources and talents, we can do together what none of us could ever do alone.
