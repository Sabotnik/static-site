On a cool summer in August, over one hundred Empower Tanzania supporters  gathered at Vivian's Diner & Drinks in Des Moines to celebrate the work we've done and to help launch us into an even better, more ambitious tomorrow. Board members, staff members, volunteers, founders, and friends all gathered to share stories, bid on silent auction items, drink sangria, and eat a fabulous dinner curated by Vivian's staff. Not only were we given the privilege of the sharing  stories of the people we serve in Tanzania, but together we raised over $10,000 for our women's empowerment projects in rural Tanzania!! We are so grateful to all who attended and all who donated. So often we spend our time looking ahead to what we've yet to do, but the Women's Empowerment Event allowed us to pause and celebrate the work our teams in the states and in Tanzania has done so faithfully over the years.

Our incredible volunteers made this night happen. Before sitting down to dinner, guests enjoyed appetizers, sangria, and a new video produced by ETI highlighting our work towards women's empowerment in Tanzania. Dinner was outstanding and as people finished their dessert, we were thrilled for the opportunity to thank our honorary hosts, Dr. Jeff and Ali Carithers.
