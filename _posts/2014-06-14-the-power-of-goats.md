This week begins a whole new future for some very determined farmers in Masandare, Tanzania, as they start their training and prepare to receive their goats. &nbsp;These are strong, resilient people who are excited to become entrepreneurs in Empower Tanzania's **Integrated Farming Project**.

Thank you to **Mr. Joseph Kimbwereza** and his leadership in managing this program, and thank you to **Tunzo Simon** who leads the farmers in Hedaruâ€¦.the mothership of the program. &nbsp;We couldn't do it without you!
