 Integrated farming appeals to women in the Same District., who do most of the farming. Improved techniques that bring increased income impact them in a huge way.

Integrated farming appeals to women in the Same District., who do much of the farming. Improved techniques that bring increased income impact them in a huge way.  Women make up at least 50% of all our participants in the project.<!--more-->

This week begins a whole new future for some very determined farmers in Masandare, Tanzania, as they start their training and prepare to receive their goats.  These are strong, resilient people who are excited to become entrepreneurs in Empower Tanzania's <strong>Integrated Farming Project</strong>.


Thank you to <strong>Mr. Joseph Kimbwereza</strong> and his leadership in managing this program, and thank you to <strong>Tunzo Simon</strong> who leads the farmers in Hedaru....the mothership of the program.  We couldn't do it without you!
