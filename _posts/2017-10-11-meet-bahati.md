â€œI am married and my husband was a drunkard who beat me. But after I joined the Empower Tanzania (ETI) support group, he stopped drinking and beating me. We are still together. He knows what Empower Tanzania is doing for me and he wants a program like this for men. The economic activities can lead to a good life. We now have money for the kids to go to school. We have a healthy family life. I learned saving and budgeting from ETI. I am in a small business and sell soap and vegetables in the market all because of education by ETI. ETI opened my mind and put cash in my pocket. We are thankful."
