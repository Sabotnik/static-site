In Pangaro, Tanzania, if you are a Pare or Maasai woman with little access to health care, your odds of surviving childbirth are not good.  Many women receive no prenatal care, and most deliver at home. The many kilometers to the nearest clinic are just too much when they are in labor.  ETI build a Safe Motherhood Clinic in a similar area called Nadururu, and it now provides prenatal care, baby care, deliveries, and even some basic health care once a month for the local women.

We are excited to begin construction of our second Safe Motherhood Clinic in Pangaro soon!  The funding is nearly complete, training of the local women is underway to provide daily care at the clinic, and plans for the building are almost finished.  Stay tuned, it's going to be an exciting year at Pangaro!
