Haika Mnzava is a [Community Health Educator](https://empowertz.org/programs/health/){: target="_blank"} who lives in a village in rural Tanzania called Vudee. She is one of 33 women educated and equipped to to teach her community about vital health information.

On this day, Haika was on her way to Hembua Primary School to present a lesson to the 12- and 13-year-olds in Class 5. She holds her portable projector in her hands and an excitement in her heart. **"I enjoy the children so much\! I love seeing them and teaching them about how to take care of their bodies and how to avoid disease."&nbsp;**

Amidst the [Covid-19 pandemic](https://empowertz.org/covid-19response/){: target="_blank"}, Haika's efforts to educate are ongoing. She continues to distribute information in her ward about the virus and how people can protect themselves. **In many ways, Empower Tanzania's Community Health Educators have become front-line helpers in the midst of the pandemic. These women not only have the training, but also the long-established trust and respect of their communities.** Because of this, Haika and the other 32 CHEs have been able to use their influence to save lives.
