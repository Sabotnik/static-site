It is with GREAT excitement that we get to post pictures of the new **Safe Motherhood Clinic** at **Pangaro, Tanzania**!  This clinic is the second we have built, and like the first at Nadururu, is located in a mixed Maasai and Pare Tribe area.  It is extremely remote, so the new clinic with its birth attendants and monthly visit by the local doctors or nurses will radically improve the infant and maternal mortality problem in this area.

Congratulations to **Elibariki Kisimbo of ETI** for overseeing the work, to all the **people of Pangaro** for their vision, their commitment, their contributions, and their VERY hard work, to the **donors from the U.S.** who helped to fund it, and to the **Des Moines Rotary Club** who gave the money for the water collection system that will supply safe water to the clinic.

The next step will be to furnish the clinic with equipment so it can begin to see patients.  Stay tuned!
