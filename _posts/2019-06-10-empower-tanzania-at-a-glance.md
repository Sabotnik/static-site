For over a decade, Empower Tanzania has worked in partnership with rural Tanzanians. We address underlying issues that hinder resiliency in rural areas, such as healthcare, education, agriculture practices, markets for products, and access to clean water.

Success requires us to work together with communities to create a vision and a long-term commitment beyond the life of a project. Here we are, at a glance...

**1: WE ARE A LISTENING ORG**

We listen to the people living in Tanzania and our staff on the ground there. We don't presume to know all the answers; rather, we recognize that sustainable change comes from listening closely and developing culturally appropriate programming and partnerships.&nbsp;

**2: WE EMPLOY TANZANIANS**

…And rely on them to lead the way\! We employ 10 highly competent staff members at our headquarters in Same, Tanzania. Each was born in Tanzania and comes to us with great training, wisdom, and cultural understanding. We spend as much $$ in Tanzania as possible in order to bolster the local economy.

**3: EDUCATION IS KEY IN EVERYTHING WE DO**

Education is foundational to long-term change. We equip school-age students, healthcare workers, community members, committee leaders (everyone we work with\!) with basic knowledge and training. Everything we do includes an educational component to ensure sustainable change.

**4: SUSTAINABILITY IS A TOP PRIORITY**

We are doing our best to work ourselves out of a job\! (We really mean that\!) We know that the people we work with are capable— they often just need a "hand up." Our ultimate goal is to no longer be necessary in meeting basic needs, a thriving economy, healthcare and education for all.

**5: JOBS & PURPOSE = DIGNITY&nbsp;**

In everything we do, we engage locals and empower them through opportunity. We train people in healthcare, leave the tools necessary for well rehabilitation, encourage economic development through farming and artisanship, and more. We partner with locals to complete jobs that require labor and infrastructure and we invest in solutions together.

**6: A SEAT AT THE TABLE**

One clear measure of success is in the number of women who now have leadership roles within their communities. We surveyed 33 of our Community Health Educators who are part of our Improving Women’s Health Program and found that 85% currently hold a government position and 2/3 have increased their involvement in government or community organizations since they entered the program. This is how policy and systemic improvements are made\!

**7: WHERE YOU LIVE SHOULD NOT DETERMINE WHETHER YOU LIVE**

Tanzania there is no Medicaid, no Social Security, no subsidized housing, no food stamps, and no social safety net. And yet a U.S. dollar will stretch practically beyond imagination in one of the poorest countries in the world. We believe that regardless of where your passport is issued, you have a right to basic human dignity. We work toward access and equality every single day.
