Our work is receiving national attention in Tanzania and we couldn't be more proud of our hardworking staff, program director, volunteers, and supporters who have worked tirelessly to create a phenomenal program that is changing lives. Recently, we have been recognized for our work on the [Reproductive Health and Relationships Program](https://empowertz.org/reproductive/)&nbsp;by two national news outlets.

If you speak Swahili, you're in for a treat. If you don't, just know that Empower Tanzania is making headlines.

This report about the [Reproductive Health and Relationships Program](https://empowertz.org/reproductive/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;appeared on the evening news of the main national television station, ITV, in Tanzania on September 9. (Click the photo of Country Director Elibariki Kisimbo to hear the full story.):
