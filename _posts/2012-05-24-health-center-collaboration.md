Mwanga Parish of the ELCT (Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania) and Peace Lutheran Church, Pella, Iowa, of the ELCA have been cooperating for three years in providing AIDS testing services, diapers for new babies, mosquito netting for small children, and diet supplements for babies and AIDS patients. They also provide some over the counter medications, such as antibacterial cream, Tylenol and aspirin, to needy patients.

Money is provided by Peace Lutheran for all items to be purchased in Tanzania by the health center. Diapers are made by members of Peace Lutheran and sent, with donated over the counter medications, with travelers who are going to Tanzania. The planning for this programs was done primarily by the health center staff, in consultation with members of Peace Lutheran. The nurse who is head of the AIDS services at the Mwanga Health Center reports quarterly on their expenditure of the funds sent.
