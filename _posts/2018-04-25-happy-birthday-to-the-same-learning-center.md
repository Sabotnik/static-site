Happy One Year of Happiness!

April 22nd marked one year since we opened the Same Learning Center with 40 students and one teacher.<!--more-->

Today, we boast a student population of 62 and employ five staff. We are so happy to share this milestone and triumph with you, our incredible supporters and the Empower Tanzania staff, board of directors, volunteers—all of whom make the program possible.

This month, we're celebrating what we've achieved. (1) We have succeeded to bring hope to 62 students who had lost the hope in their life! (2) We celebrate our largest cohort. (3) We celebrate our super supporters across two continents. Together, we are creatively make a huge impact.

I look forward to fighting poverty through education with you in 2018. On behalf of everyone at the Same Learning Centre, I wish you a year of health, joy, and prosperity.

—Yoeza
