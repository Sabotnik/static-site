title: Water is Flowing at Ndatu!
categories: [health]

Almost 18 months of continued effort by Summit4Water and the local people of Ndatu, Tanzania, there is water at the Uraki School!  On June 5, ETI partner Allan Klotche of Summit4water reported that the water was turned on for the first time at the primary school.  The Uraki School is located 7 km from the nearest source of water, so this is a really big deal to these kids, and a great improvement in their lives.  There is still much to do, but this milestone deserves some applause!
