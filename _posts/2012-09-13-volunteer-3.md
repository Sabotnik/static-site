<strong>Penny Dickey</strong> has a relatively long and involved history with ETI, and has become someone we know we can depend on for insight and ideas when we are working on projects that deal with women's health.

First as a nurse, and currently as the COO of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Penny has always had the health and well-being of women as a major theme in her life.  Her years of professional experience as well as her practical nature make her a valuable part of the team here at ETI.

A veteran of several trips to Tanzania to work on the Palliative Care Project and the Safe Motherhood Project, Penny has a great understanding of the situations we face as we try to find ways to improve the lives and health of women and their families.  She also has the added benefit of being a riot to travel with, and willing to dive headfirst into any adventure you throw her way!

THANK YOU to volunteer Penny Dickey.  We wouldn't be as good without you!
