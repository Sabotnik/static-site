"My husband died and his family didn't help us. They chased me from their family, so I started a new life with my children. Nothing helped and I was discouraged and I felt that I was inferior. Then I went to Empower Tanzania and attended their seminars and counseling. The counseling helped me become confident; I know that I can do more. Empower Tanzania taught me skills and I have started a small business and now I can feed my family. I am energetic because of Empower Tanzania and I no longer feel inferior."
This is Part III of a three-part series on our BEYOND Gender Based Violence program.
