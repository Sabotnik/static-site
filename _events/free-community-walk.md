Next Walk - TBD Fall 2021

FIT Rx will open its doors to the community, offering water outside for your walk!  To keep our distance we will only gather outside and we ask that you respect others' space.  Runners welcome!   Dolly the Gym Dog will be there!  Bring your dogs and families!  Doggie bags are provided to keep our neighborhood clean!
