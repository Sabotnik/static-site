The Same Learning Center offers enhanced English instruction to 40 students from primary schools in the area. The students meet at the newly refurbished Learning Center once per week after school to work with highly skilled English teachers to improve their reading skills in English. On Saturday, they participate in daily living instruction such as animal husbandry, growing crops, and gardening. The goals of the program (established in 2017) are to 1) increase the academic success of the underserved, impoverished students of government schools in the Same Region by providing English language tutoring and academic support, and 2) increase the number of students who pass the Form 4 exam.
