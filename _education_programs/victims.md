Empower Tanzania works with women who are victims of domestic violence by providing support groups, counseling, and microfinance opportunities. What began with one group of ten women has multiplied to a ten sites serving ten women each and a full-time employee devoted to the program.  When you educate a victim of domestic violence, you empower her to change her life and the lives of her children.
