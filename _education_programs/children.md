”Most Vulnerable Children” is the phrase used by the Tanzanian government to describe children at the highest risk in rural areas. Typically lacking family support or basic access to education, they are the target of Empower Tanzania’s education program at Msindo. The Msindo Most Vulnerable Children’s Program provides two hot and nutritious meals each Saturday and teaches basic life skills such as hygiene and nutrition, gardening, and animal husbandry. Our donors also provide uniforms for primary school, enabling children to attend school during the week and changing the course of lives forever.
