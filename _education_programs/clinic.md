title: Child Birth Clinic
---
In 2010 in the remote Maasai village of Nadururu, women were dying in childbirth at a stunning rate of 30%. With the nearest health facility over 20 km away and no transportation, there was virtually no prenatal care. If a problem developed during childbirth, the mother-to-be began walking with the hope of reaching the hospital in time to deliver her baby. More often than not, these pregnant women would die along the way. Several generous donors provided the necessary funds for Empower Tanzania and the Maasai tribe at Nadururu to construct a clinic, train ten women as birth attendants, and create an ongoing relationship with the nearest hospital—three hours away by car. The birth attendants provide basic prenatal care and identify problem cases early so they can be referred to the hospital. Everyone in the village participated in the success of the clinic: the men who provided sweat equity in helping with facility construction, the women who were selected to train as birth attendants, and the women who volunteered to cover the birth attendants’ daily chores while they were away at training. With improved prenatal education, cooperation among all the villagers, and a linkage to the health system, lives have been improved. What we learned during the implementation of this project was duplicated when we later built a clinic in the Maasai village of Pangaro. These clinics was handed over to complete local control in 2018.
