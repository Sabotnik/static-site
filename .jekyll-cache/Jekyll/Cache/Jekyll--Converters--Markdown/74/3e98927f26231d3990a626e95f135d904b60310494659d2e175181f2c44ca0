I"š<p>In the first three months of the Improving Womenâ€™s Health Program, over 22,000 people in the Same District attended educational workshops on how to keep their water clean and safe!</p>

<p>At Empower Tanzania, we are pretty optimistic people, but this statistic blew us out of the water! Â People are clearly excited to get some good solid information that will help keep their families safe and healthy.</p>

<p>Project Coordinator, Efrancia Nzota reports, â€œIWHP aims at reaching all the people of the Same District. Â The main target is women, as we believe that â€œwhen you educate women, you educate the society.â€ Â Same District, according to the 2012 Tanzania census has a total population of 269,807 people, with 138,292 of them women. Â With this number of women, a lot can be done. Â Improving Womenâ€™s Health Program basically provides health education; it started with safe and clean water, and is now doing hand washing training. Â Next will be nutrition, and then others as we develop the curriculum. Â Each subject is taught for 3 months. Â Regarding the safe and clean water topic, we were able to meet 22,996 people, with 15,068 of them, or 65%, being women. Â Within these women we found mothers, wives, sisters and daughters. Â From an African perspective, women are the key to the householdsâ€™ activities and from there we can also say they are key to household health.â€</p>

<p>She goes on to say, â€œThe Community Health Educators are amazing people to work with! Â They know the community very well, but the most important thing is they have great influence in the community, and are very convincing. Â I got a story from one Health Educator who was doing a presentation where an older man was very resistant to change. Â He asked the question, â€˜Madam, I have been here since my childhood and have now grown this old. Â Why are you telling us to treat our water, while our fathers drank the same water for all these years and lived healthy lives? Â I have never treated water, and I have lived long as well!â€</p>

<p>The Health Educator answered, â€˜Father, at that time, very few people lived here, and people really respected the water sources. Â Nowadays, the population has grown, and people live near the water sources. Â Agricultural activities are done with use of chemicals, and people direct their run-off water from washing, bathing and everything else they do towards the water source. Â Some even do laundry in the water source. Â Tell me if Iâ€™m lying!â€™</p>

<p>The old man answered, â€˜You are very right, my child. Â This new generation is no good. Â Nowadays people are so different from our age. Â I was lying to myself all these days, and from now on I will not drink the untreated water. Â I will ask my wife to give me boiled water. Â Thank you my child.â€™</p>

<p>From the visit the Health Educator made, she said everyone in the old manâ€™s family was surprised, for no one had been able to change him before. What is more interesting is that I get this same story from many different Health Educators in many different areas. Â Safe and clean water have been accepted by people so well, they are also responding well to the hand washing education now, as it is similar to the previous topic.â€</p>

<p>Obviously, there is a lot to celebrate in this program! Â We will continue to add new topics in basic healthy living every three months, with a goal to reach every women in the Same District with our message!</p>
