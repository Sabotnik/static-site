<p>Judith is staying with her grandmother at Kiwanja, which is close to Same Town. (Pronounced Sah-may Town; home to Empower Tanzania headquarters.) Judith was orphaned at a young age and circumstances became even tougher for her when her grandmother passed away. <strong> Judith failed even to go to school because she had no school uniform or stationaries for schooling.</strong></p>

<p>Judith was under constant pressure from her fellow peer group to be married. For a girl raised in a male-dominated society, this should have been the end. But not for Judith.</p>

<p>Judith met Teacher Bertha from Majengo Primary School and explained to her what she faced. Teacher Bertha connected her to Empower Tanzania. This connection was a turning point for Judith.</p>

<p>Judith was assisted by Empower Tanzania with all of her school expenses: school uniform, shoes, stationaries, supplies, and school lunch. Judith also started to attend lessons at the Same Learning Center every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. <strong>She has proven herself to be a superstar for her strength to move forward despite her circumstances.</strong></p>

<p>From a life overcoming challenges, Judith believes that Empower Tanzania— through the support of the Same Learning Center—changed her life completely. As Judith says, “Life is a struggle without education; it’s had to survive without it.”</p>

<p><strong>Judith wants to be a doctor because her grandmother died of thorax cancer. When she was sick, they had not even a single coin to help her be cured. In particular, Judith wants to serve others who are low privileged.</strong></p>
