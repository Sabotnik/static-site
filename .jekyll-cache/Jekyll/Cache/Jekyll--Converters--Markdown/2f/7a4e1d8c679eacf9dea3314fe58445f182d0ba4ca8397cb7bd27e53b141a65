I"‘<p>In 2010, eighteen year old Mackline Mcharo of Hedaru finished secondary school. Â Like most girls in Tanzania, she could not continue her education, so she began to wonder what would happen to her. Â How does a girl without a trade or a college education support herself in a rural village in Tanzania? Â Typically, she gets married, and begins the cycle of farming and raising children and barely surviving that will consume the rest of her life as a subsistence farmer. Â She knows her odds of contracting HIV from her husband will be high, and she knows that her future is set in stone. Â Thatâ€™s what it is to be a young girl in rural Tanzania.</p>
