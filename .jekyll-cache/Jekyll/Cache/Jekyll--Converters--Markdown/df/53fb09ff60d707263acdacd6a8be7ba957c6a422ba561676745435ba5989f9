I"E<p><em>Today, as an employee of Empower Tanzania, I want to give a shout out to my boss, and our Executive Director, <strong>Phil Latessa.</strong>  Phil works tirelessly for far less pay than he is worth, out of passion for our mission. I think I speak for all of us when I say he leads us with a very experienced and graceful hand and we would follow him anywhere.  When I read this article, I couldn’t resist posting a little praise and recognition …he is the poster child for what John Maxwell is talking about when he describes a great leader! –**Sheri Krumm</em></p>
