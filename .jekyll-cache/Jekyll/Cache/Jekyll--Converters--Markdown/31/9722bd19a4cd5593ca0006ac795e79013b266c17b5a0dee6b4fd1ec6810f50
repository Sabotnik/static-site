I"ž<p>As we all know, clean water and sanitation is more important now than ever. Empower Tanzania continues to work with rural Tanzanians to ensure that as many people as possible have access to clean water. Our project managers, volunteers, and donors have been a huge help in providing clean water (and thus health and safety!) to thousands of rural Tanzanians over the years. We continue to be so grateful.Â </p>
