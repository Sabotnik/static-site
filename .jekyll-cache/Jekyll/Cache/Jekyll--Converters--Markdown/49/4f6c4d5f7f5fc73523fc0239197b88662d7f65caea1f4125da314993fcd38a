I"Ž<p>Because of our completed water projects over the past decadeâ€”rehabilitating broken-down wells, digging new wells, training well mechanics, and empowering communities with WASH training and educationâ€”thousands of people in rural Tanzania have access clean water, which is essential to hygiene and health. We continue to promote hand-washing and crucial hygiene measures during this time.</p>
