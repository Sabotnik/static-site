<p>Tanzaniaâ€™s national elections will be held on October 28, 2020. For Tanzanian women to improve their social and economic status, they must have a seat at the table to make progress toward gender equality. Joyceâ€™s role as a government representative shows how this can be done.</p>

<p><strong>Political empowerment is a game-changer for women and weâ€™re thrilled to see that many of the Tanzanian women we work with have increased their involvement in government and community organizations since entering our programs.Â </strong>Dozens have been elected to positions of power and are serving on local government and community committees.Joyce is known for her humility and attention to detail. Part of her responsibilities include participating in village conflict resolution, sitting on the welfare committee, and participating in village decision-making meetings.</p>

<p><strong><em>â€œI hope to make decisions for the betterment of the whole community,â€ she says. â€œI believe we can bring peace by resolving different conflicts in the community.â€</em></strong></p>

<p>Gender equality is a major issue in Tanzania and worldwide. Our international team at Empower Tanzania works toward creating conditions for women like Joyce who desire equal rights and social progress. With confidence, skills, wisdom, and a belief in herself, Joyce is working not only for her children and her community, but through her leadership roles, has the opportunity to bring gender equality and justice to many.</p>
