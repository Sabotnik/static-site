I"!<p><strong>There are numerous superstitions in East Africa about albinism, a genetic deficiency of pigment of the skin, hair and eyes.</strong>   Many East Africans believe people with albinism lack souls, are possessed by the devil or have mental retardation.  There are also beliefs that their body parts have magical properties and can make one rich, treat disease or prevent HIV/AIDS.  This leads to murder and dismemberment of people with albinism and mystical usage or sale of their body parts by witch doctors or other sorcerers.</p>
