I"û<p>In Tanzania, our team of Community Health Educators (CHEs) is working hard to distribute updated health information all over Same District. Over 20,000 posters and handouts will ultimately be distributed to thousands of people across the district. Each Community Health Educator will take on the responsibility of distributing an average of 500 posters and 150 handouts within her territory. In doing so, all protective measures (wearing masks, hand-washing, and social distancing) will be observed.</p>
