I"	<p>Even though schools in Tanzania are closed for the foreseeable future, we’ve continued to feed the children who rely on Empower Tanzania food support through their participation in the Same Learning Center and the Msindo Kids’ Club. Education Program Director Yoeza Mnzava and his team safely delivered a month’s worth of food and supplies to over one hundred families. (5 kg of rice, 10 kg of corn, 5 kg of bean, 1 liter of cooking oil and soap.) With your support, we will repeat this action as necessary.</p>
