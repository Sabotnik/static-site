I"Ì<p>Goats breed like rabbits! Â NOW what do we do!?!</p>

<p>You canâ€™t even imagine our excitement over the most recent visit to the Nanny Project in Hedaru! Â It has been a year since we sent our farmers to Tengeru Agriculture College for an education in animal husbandry, and then purchased the first goats for 12 farmers.</p>

<p>Phase One was all about learning to keep these new high-end dairy goats, learning to find food for them in the extreme drought conditions that exist in much of Tanzania, and figuring out how to keep them healthy and reproducing. Â Of course, the question that has been on everyoneâ€™s mind, is â€œwas it worth it?â€. Â ETI, funded by partner St. Andrewâ€™s Lutheran Church in Ames, IA, invested over $12,000 into 15 farmers, and THE FARMERS invested almost $300 each to build pens. Â These animals take more care than simply sending them out to graze with a 10-year old boy, and as anyone who has worked with farmers knows, itâ€™s not easy to change the way things are done. Â â€œBut weâ€™ve always done it that wayâ€ is a universal theme, and our farmers had to be innovators and willing to think in a whole new way.</p>

<p>Niatiweâ€™s story pretty much sums up what is possible, however, when you have a farmer with initiative and a willingness to learn. Â She started with two goats, and today, has 7 goats, the first set of twins in the project, and has expanded her farm to meat goats. Â She raises the meat goats the same way she does her dairy goats, and breeds her male dairy goat with them to improve the quality of the meat goats.</p>

<p>Niatiwe has also expanded into gardening, and is looking for alternative crops, like garlic, that sell for a very high price in the market. Â She has only about 1/2 acre of land, but she has dreams of expanding into every inch of it, and finding ways to make it produce.</p>

<p>When we interviewed Niatiwe, she agreed that it is difficult during the drought. Â They must travel great distances to find the food for the animals, or buy food, which pretty much takes all the profit from selling the milk. Â They are experimenting with ways to overcome this challenge. Â Nearby farmer Tunzo Simon has built a raised â€œhay rackâ€ where he stockpiled grasses and corn silage when the weather was good, and they were available. Â Now, when prices are high, he has a lot to feed his goats.</p>

<p>Another idea is to purchase a small motorcycle between 5 nearby farmers, and share it so that they can use it to go gather grasses in the mountains or near the river during the dry season. Â Because these farmers have been working together from the beginning, they continue to brainstorm ideas together to address the challenges, and are coming up with some remarkably creative solutions!</p>

<p>After sharing the challenges with us, we asked the obvious questionâ€¦.â€has it been worth it?â€ Â Niatiwe burst out laughing! Â â€œOf course it has!â€ she answered. â€œMy children drink milk every day and are healthy. Â I had to move my raised bed over here, because I am building a new latrine. Â I have painted the inside of my house, and now I am putting new plaster and paint on the outside, Â and in just a few months, I will pay for the confirmation of my oldest daughter. Â All of this is because of my goats.â€</p>

<p>Niatiwe is living the dream we hoped for when we began this project, and we are excited to move on to phase two. Â Right now, most of the farmers are consuming about 1/2 ltr per day of their milk, and selling a few litres at around $.75 per liter. Â That means they are earning about a dollar a day from their small herds, once you figure in the cost of feed and vet care.</p>

<p>$1 a day? Â Is that enough?</p>

<p>Well, if you consider that statistically, the average income in this part of Tanzania is about a dollar a day, then yes, for a first year project, that is enough. Â They have doubled their annual income at that rate, and the herds are growing well, so it will only get better from here.</p>

<p>Yes, I think we can say it has been a huge success!</p>

<p>Phase Two will begin in January, focused on learning more business and marketing skills, and gathering data to support the stories we are seeing.Â  Stay tuned!</p>
