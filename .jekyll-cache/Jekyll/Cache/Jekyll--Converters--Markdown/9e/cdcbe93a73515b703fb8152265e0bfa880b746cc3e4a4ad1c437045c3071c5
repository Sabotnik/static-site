I"Ý<p>It is with GREAT excitement that we get to post pictures of the new <strong>Safe Motherhood Clinic</strong> at <strong>Pangaro, Tanzania</strong>! Â This clinic is the second we have built, and like the first at Nadururu, is located in a mixed Maasai and Pare Tribe area. Â It is extremely remote, so the new clinic with its birth attendants and monthly visit by the local doctors or nurses will radically improve the infant and maternal mortality problem in this area.</p>
