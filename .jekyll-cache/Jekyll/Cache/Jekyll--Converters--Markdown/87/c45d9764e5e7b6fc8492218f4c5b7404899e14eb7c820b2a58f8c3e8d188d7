This kidsâ€™ club will provide supplemental education, two nutritious meals, and support for 50 children identified by their community as in great need of assistance. The program also provides the children with their uniforms for primary school, enabling them to attend classes during the week. Weâ€™ve seen tremendous success at our original kidsâ€™ club in Mramba and are overjoyed to open a second location!</p>

<p>In his report to our U.S. team, Elibariki Kisimbo, Empower Tanzaniaâ€™s Director of Development in Tanzania, said this: â€œOn July 30th, we had a wonderful event to celebrate the opening of our second childrenâ€™s club at Msindo. It was such a wonderful and unique event that demonstrated our goal to improve the lives of rural Tanzanians and to empower our communities.â€ Eli reported that there were many stakeholders at the event, including the guests of honor: Bishop Charles Mjema of ELCT Pare Diocese and Mwl. Chambua Tumaini, General Secretary of the ELCT Pare Diocese. Also in attendance were the 50 identified children and their parents/guardians, Empower Tanzania staff, a District Education Officer, Msindo Ward Education Officer, the leaders and village chairpersons of the five primary schools where our students attend classes during the week (Msindo, Chabaru, Mararo, Duma, and Mbakweni), a representative from Compassion â€“ Same Centre, the Msindo Ward Executive Officer, members of the media, and others. According to Eli, the high participation and publicity of this event will help increase ownership and ensure sustainability of the program, as well as increase support from both the community and local government. â€œThis event was really far beyond what we expected,â€ concluded Eli in his report. â€œI was very much touched to see the community is motivated to contribute for their kids. Truly, Empower Tanzania is â€˜empowering the communityâ€™.â€ Eli also reminded us of something we fundamentally believe. In Kiswahili there is a slogan that says, â€œELIMU NI UFUNGUO WA MAISHA.â€ Translated, this means â€œEDUCATION IS THE KEY TO LIFE.â€ We canâ€™t wait to see whatâ€™s in store for the 50 young people that so many have come together and committed time and resources to. What great lives they have in store!</p>
