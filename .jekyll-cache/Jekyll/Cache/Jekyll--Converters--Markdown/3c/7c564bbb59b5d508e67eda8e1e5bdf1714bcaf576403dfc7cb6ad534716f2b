I" <p>In 2010, the Integrated Farming Project (IFP) began as a way to give farmers in the village of Hedaru the skills to grow more nutritious food in larger quantity on small pieces of land around their homes. The concept was simple: train 20 people in animal husbandry and gardening, give them each two pregnant dairy goats, and help them learn to support each other as they build their farms. The project requires each new farmer to pass an animal forward to help someone else begin a farm, and pass an animal backward to help support the cost of the ongoing training. Since itâ€™s inception, the program has grown to over 100 farmer-entrepreneurs in three communities. In many cases, the farmers have added bio-gas cooking systems, new latrines for their families, remodeled their homes, installed clean water systems, introduced other kinds of animals (primarily chickens), and purchased motorcycles to use in gathering grasses to feed the animals. They started tracking profit and loss and now farm as a business, not just a way to feed their own families. A group of farmers received training as para-veterinarians and the program graduated to complete local control in 2018.</p>
