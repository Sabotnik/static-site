<p>Next Walk - 9:00a - 10:00p on Sunday, May 9, 2021</p>

<p>FIT Rx will open its doors to the community, offering water outside for your walk between 10:00a - 12:00p!  To keep our distance we will only gather outside and we ask that you respect othersâ€™ space.  Runners welcome!   Dolly the Gym Dog will be there!  Bring your dogs and families!  Doggie bags are provided to keep our neighborhood clean!</p>
