I"¢<p>At Empower Tanzania we believe that education changes everything.Â  We also have a mission to serve the most vulnerable populations in Tanzania, the people in the extreme rural areas. Â Nowhere do these two beliefs come together more than in our newest health program, CHAP. The Community-Hospital Alliance Program, or CHAP, is a joint effort between Empower Tanzania and Global Health Administration Partners, a program of non-profit Global Health Ministries, that works to enhance administrative practices in medical facilities in Tanzania and elsewhere. The vision of this project is to address a key problem in the Maasai communities of Tanzania: Â they have a difficult time accessing the health care system because they often live many miles from a health care facility, and have no transportation other than their feet. Â A seriously ill person simply cannot walk 10 miles in the desert bush land to reach a doctor.</p>
