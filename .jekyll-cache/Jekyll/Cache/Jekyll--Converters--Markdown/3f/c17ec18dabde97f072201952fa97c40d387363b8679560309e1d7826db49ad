<p>“Before I joined the Same Learning Center, I was very shy before my classmates and the teachers. Our humble family life made me feel inferior and unworthy before everyone I meet. I was often unable to attend school but would see my friends eating lunch under a tree. After joining the Same Learning Center in 2018, I was given a school lunch and a school uniform that could be worn to school. During our time at the Center, our teachers show us great love and build up the courage to express ourselves and to be confident. We are all taught to help others in our Centre. At school I do well in my studies. I will study hard to be a doctor so I can help my family and the community around me. I am grateful for the chance I have been given.”</p>
