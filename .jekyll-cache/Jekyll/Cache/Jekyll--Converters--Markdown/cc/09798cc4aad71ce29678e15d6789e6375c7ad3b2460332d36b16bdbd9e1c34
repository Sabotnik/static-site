<p>When supporters in the Quad Cities heard about the need for clean water in the village of Nadaruru, Tanzania, they jumped to action. A group of volunteers dedicated the 10th annual Water Party to raising enough funds for the 1,750 people who were gathering water from this source:</p>

<p>On a pleasant night in November, 500 guests gathered in downtown Davenport, Iowa to enjoy wine, beer, and whiskey tasting, mocktails, small bites, and a short presentation. Watch the moving video shown during the presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/M_l8VY2PPR8" target="_blank">HERE</a>. Between donations, ticket sales, an art auction, a silent auction, a raffle, and merchandise, the event raised $76,000 for water projects in Tanzania. We are so grateful for the efforts of these passionate volunteers and are anxious to get clean water flowing in Nadaruru!</p>
