I"ë<p>In Pangaro, Tanzania, if you are a Pare or Maasai woman with little access to health care, your odds of surviving childbirth are not good. Â Many women receive no prenatal care, and most deliver at home. The many kilometers to the nearest clinic are just too much when they are in labor. Â ETI build a Safe Motherhood Clinic in a similar area called Nadururu, and it now provides prenatal care, baby care, deliveries, and even some basic health care once a month for the local women.</p>
