I"K<p>Mwanga Parish of the ELCT (Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania), Pare Diocese, and Peace Lutheran Church, Pella, Iowa, of the ELCA, SE Iowa Synod, cooperated in drilling a deep well about seven kilometers northwest of Mwanga, Tanzania. The well is centrally located about 2 1/2 kilometers from three villages that have no water source. In the past, villagers drank contaminated water from a hole dug in the bed of a dry stream and took their cattle ten kilometers to drink. The animals were watered only every other day. The Mwanga Parish secured the land on which the well was drilled, and local residents cleared the land. The well was drilled to 86 meters and has a solar pump and solar panels since there is no electricity in the area. A house for a guard and a storage tank were built, as well as a watering trough for cattle.</p>
