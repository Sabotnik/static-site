Goats, ducks, and chickens. Each animal helps farmers greatly increase their status and income. Eating meat, milk, and eggs benefits their health and the extra income can improve all aspects of life, including allowing parents to send their children to school. A third quarter visit to 31 farms conducted by Steven M. Kihoko, PLFO Same District,  and Mr. Joseph Kimbwereza, project manager, was successful.  “All the farmers appreciated this individual visit because I reminded them some of the important procedures of how to manage their project, therefore they requested me to make frequent visits and also they requested the donors to continue supporting the verterinary officer in charge for supervision activities,” said Mr. Kihoko. Goats — Goats are the new cow. They produce milk and are able to many have kids, which means more milk and more livestock.  The farmer-entrepreneurs can sell their kids to other budding farmers, promoting a cycle of prosperity.</p>
