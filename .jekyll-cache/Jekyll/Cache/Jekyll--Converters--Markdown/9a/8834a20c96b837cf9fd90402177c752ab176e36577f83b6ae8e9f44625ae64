I"<p>At ETI headquarters in Same, it is a day to be grateful for the generosity of an American Diplomat named <strong>Todd Benson</strong> at the American Embassy in Dar Es Salaam.  Todd was leaving the country recently, and decided to donate his gently used vehicle to an NGO working in the area.  He loved what ETI was doing….so today we have our first official company car!</p>
