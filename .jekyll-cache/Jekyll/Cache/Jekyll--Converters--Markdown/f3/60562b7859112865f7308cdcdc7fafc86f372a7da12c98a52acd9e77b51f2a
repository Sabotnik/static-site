I"<p>In February, 2010, ETI Board Member and Project Manager Sheri Krumm visited the village of Hedaru to celebrate the completion of the next to last step in a three year water project.Â  The project is a collaboration between the ETI, the Hedaru Village Water Committee, Rotary International, and St. Andrewâ€™s Lutheran Church in Ames, Iowa.Â  It includes a catchment system high in the mountains at the source of the spring that evenly divides the water between mountain farmers, and the villagers below, as well as construction of a 20,000 gallon storage tank.Â  Most recently, the villagers installed 7 km of pipe to connect the whole system together, and today, <strong>water is flowing to 20,000 people in Hedaru who have not had adequate water in over 10 years!</strong></p>
