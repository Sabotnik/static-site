I"y<p>The Beyond Gender-Based Violence Program was developed to respond to the high levels of domestic violence in Tanzania. The program established 10 support groups in various communities, each serving 10 survivors of gender-based violence. The 100 survivors in the program received twice-monthly group counseling for two years and showed improvement in depression and anxiety scores on culturally appropriate psychological testing instruments. They have now embarked on economic strengthening projects that will generate income, autonomy, and dignity. The women in this program have each been trained in solid business practices and now want to be called “entrepreneurs.” They are involved in the production and distribution of items such as batik fabric and reusable menstrual pads. What was once a program of survival is now one of complete empowerment and economic opportunity!</p>
