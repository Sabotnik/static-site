I"˜<p>In the remote village of Katahe, in the NE part of Tanzania, everyone understands what this means. Â The village is in a semi-arid area, and inhabited by both Maasai tribe, and Pare tribe. Â There is a river nearby, suitable for watering the animals, but the water is muddy, and full of runoff and disease, so it is extremely unsafe for humans. Â Never mind the crocodiles and snakes that live there.</p>
