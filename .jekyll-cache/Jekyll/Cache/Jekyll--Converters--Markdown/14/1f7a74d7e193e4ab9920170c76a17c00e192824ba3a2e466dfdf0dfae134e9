I"W<p>We’ve got BIG news! Empower Tanzania is welcoming two new American staff members this spring! Joining our Executive Director, Phil Latessa, our Development Coordinator, Sheri Krumm, and our team of wonderful volunteers, we’re excited to announce that we have two new stateside staff members on board! Becky Lopez is joining us as an accountant and Leslie Klipsch will fill the role of Director of Communication and Development. </p>

<p>Empower Tanzania is unique in that the vast majority of our staff is made up of men and women living and working in Tanzania. As Executive Director Phil Latessa often says, we in the U.S. find money and provide accountability to the funders, but our staff in Tanzania does the “heavy lifting.” We cannot say enough about how much we appreciate and value the contribution of our on-the-ground team in Tanzania. And now we’re adding stateside support! Great things are happening at ETI! Of course, beyond our full-time and part-time international staff, there are dozens of people who work with ETI to help make us successful. We are so grateful to our tremendous volunteers. And we also appreciate YOU! Empower Tanzania is experiencing a time of tremendous growth and as we work hard to professionalize our organization and keep our impact strong and relevant, we appreciate your continued interest and generosity.</p>

<p>Want to stay in the loop? If you haven’t already done so, we’d love for you to join our mailing list, “like” us on Facebook, or find us on Twitter. No matter which you prefer, we’d love to connect. Thanks for sharing in our excitement!</p>
