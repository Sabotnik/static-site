I"ñ<p>Almost 18 months of continued effort by Summit4Water and the local people of Ndatu, Tanzania, there is water at the Uraki School! Â On June 5, ETI partner Allan Klotche of Summit4water reported that the water was turned on for the first time at the primary school. Â The Uraki School is located 7 km from the nearest source of water, so this is a really big deal to these kids, and a great improvement in their lives. Â There is still much to do, but this milestone deserves some applause!</p>
