I"¯<p>What a pleasure it is to hear directly from our students. Read what Tatu has to say about her experience in our after-school + Saturday morning tutoring program, the Same Learning Center:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a student, I have been coming to Same Learning Centre (SLC) for 2 years now and they [teachers] have helped me reach my goal of having a good school uniform, shoes, school stationaries, person hygiene utensils, school lunch and many other things.</p>

  <p>I will soon be doing my Class 7 examination and I am confident that my scores will be high. Same Learning Centre has allowed me to become a better student and help those around me. <strong>Before joining SLC I was feeling myself nothing before every one I see, but SLC helped me to recognize myself that I am better.</strong></p>

  <p>For sure SLC has done a lot for me of which I never expected. I think in my future life I will be a teacher as the way of giving back to my community, especially to vulnerable communities. I cannot thank you enough for everything you have done to get me where I am today. Again thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
