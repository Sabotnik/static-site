I"8<p>In August, 2010 the Water Project in Hedaru was officially dedicated and handed over to the Village of Hedaru.</p>

<p>In a celebration attended by representatives of Empower Tanzania, Inc, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania - Pare Dioces, St. Andrew’s Lutheran Church of Ames, Iowa, Rotary Club of Same, and the Same District Government, as well as MANY people from the village of Hedaru, the 4-year water project was finally given to the people of Hedaru.</p>

<p>In a two-day schedule of events, visiting dignitaries, as well as all of the participating partners and the national news media visited the site of the storage tank, many of the 22 distribution points, and finally the main village distribution point. There were many speeches and GREAT celebrations for finally having abundant and clean water throughout the village.</p>

<p>Congratulation to the many hundreds of people who made this project possible! It was a great success, and model of a strong partnership, and an effectively implimented project that ETI hopes to replicate again and again.</p>
