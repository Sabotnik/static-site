I"£<p>One of our partners, St. Andrewâ€™s Lutheran Church of Ames, Iowa, recently completed a 4-year water rehabilitation project in Hedaru, Tanzania.Â  Based on a watershed survey done by the local water engineer, and coordinatedÂ Â by the Hedaru Village Water Committee, headed by Village Chairman Clement Ngoka, this water project was designed to rehabilitate a nearly 40-year-old water system that was in poor repair and did not adequately serve a population that had outgrown it.Incorporating the concept of rainwater harvesting, phase 1 was an additional catchment system built in the mountains, higher than the previous catchment, to take advantage of daily moisture in the high elevation.Phase 2 was the construction of a 22,000 gallon storage tank towards the base of the mountain, and near the village, storing excess rainfall during the rainy season for use during the rest of the year, and giving access to a population that was quite far from a stream.Phase 3 was the installation of 7 kilometers of pipe between the intake and tank, and then on down to the village tanks.The final step, completed in July of 2010, was to repair and expand the pipe throughout the village.</p>
