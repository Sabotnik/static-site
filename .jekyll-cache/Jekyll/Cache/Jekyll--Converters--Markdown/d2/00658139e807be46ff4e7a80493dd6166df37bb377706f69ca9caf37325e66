<p>What a wonderful celebration of the work that Empower Tanzania has done over the last decade! We were so grateful to gather 100 friends and supporters in Des Moines this September to toast ten years of empowerment! Weâ€™re grateful to all who attended the event and supported the effort. In addition to good cheer, over $10,000 was raised for future programming!</p>
