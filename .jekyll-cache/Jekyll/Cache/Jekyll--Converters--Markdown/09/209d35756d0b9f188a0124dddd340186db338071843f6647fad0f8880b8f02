<p class="present-before-paste">What fun it was to see the gorgeous fabric pictured above turn into the beautiful clothing pictured below!</p>

<p class="present-before-paste"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/kwazzo/" target="_blank">Kwazzo Design</a> purchased fabric hand-dyed by our 100 survivors of gender-based violence. These 100 women have undergone <a href="https://empowertz.org/health/2017/10/08/meet-rahema/" target="_blank">culturally appropriate counseling</a> over the last several years, <a href="https://empowertz.org/health/2017/10/11/meet-bahati/" target="_blank">have gained confidence and independence</a>, and are <a href="https://empowertz.org/health/2017/10/16/meet-habiba/" target="_blank">now entrepreneurs</a> who are making money for themselves and their families! </p>

<p class="present-before-paste">When designer Justine Siboma, who grew up in a refugee camp in Tanzania, heard about the women producing this beautiful fabric, she was motivated to use it in her shows and her collections. A talented designer who is on the rise, we were thrilled when she took interest!!</p>

<p class="present-before-paste">On Saturday, April 24th, at the TaxSlayer Center in Moline, Ill., Kwazzo garments made from Empower Tanzania fabric hit the runway!</p>

<p class="present-before-paste">Miss Iowa (Mikhayla Hughes-Shaw) was in attendance and was taken by the fabrics. We were thrilled to have a display and be able to tell the story of the brave, talented, hard-working women who produce such beautiful fabric.</p>

<p class="present-before-paste">Our Director of Communications, Leslie Klipsch, was on hand to receive an award on behalf of our staff in Tanzania and the 100 survivors-turned-entrepreneurs. What an honor it was to tell the story of Empower Tanzania and be acknowledged for the hard work happening in Tanzania.<img src="/uploads/befunky-collage-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
