My purpose on this trip was to be on the ground while we dug a well in a Maasai area that has never before had safe water to drink. Anticipating that well drilling does not always go exactly as expected, I wanted to be there to help make decisions on the fly. It turned out to be a good idea—we hit salt water in the first borehole and had to quickly negotiate an entirely new plan. But the truth is, other than that brief flash of activity, I didn’t do much on my visit except hug babies, laugh and dance with mamas, and show three Americans what our work is all about.Over the first six days, I had the privilege of introducing our group to the most talented people I’ve ever met.</p>
