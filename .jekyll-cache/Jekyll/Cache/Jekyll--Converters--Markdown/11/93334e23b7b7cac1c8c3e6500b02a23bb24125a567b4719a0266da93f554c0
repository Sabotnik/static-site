With the support of the District Executive Director (DED) and the District Medical Officer (DMO),Â  Empower Tanzania staff rented a vehicle and a sound system and logged HUNDREDS of miles in three different districts spreading accurate public health information. Health Programs Manager Efrancia Nzota recorded the important message (*see translation in English below) and was pleased with the results.</p>
