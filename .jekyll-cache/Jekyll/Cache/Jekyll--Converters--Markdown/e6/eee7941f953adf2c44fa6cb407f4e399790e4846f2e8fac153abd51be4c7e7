I"¦<p>ITâ€™S ALL ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPSâ€¦.</p>

<p>People often ask us, what makes ETI different? Â There are thousands of Non-Profits working in Africa. Â WHY YOU?</p>

<p>Our answer is in our simplicity. Â We are successful, because we began our life as a non-profit, or NGO, out of existing relationships. Â Most of us at ETI already had a long history working in the extreme rural areas of the Kilimanjaro and Njombe Regions of Tanzania. Â We simply wanted to join forces, combine our experience, and be more effective.</p>

<p>Today, nothing has changed, really.</p>

<p>We work in the extreme rural areas where need is the greatest.<br />We depend on local Tanzanian staff and partners for ideas, solutions, implementation, and supervision of our projects.<br />We keep the main focus of our work on improving the lives of women and children first.<br />We believe that grassroots solutions to problems can frequently make a life-changing difference to a village.<br />We work to build sustainability into everything we do, and plan from the start how to work ourselves out of the job and leave the local people in charge.</p>

<p>Our passion for these people, and our enthusiasm to see projects that really make a difference are what drive us to do our work. Â They are also what attract other people to join us, and constantly affirm our belief in the goodness and generosity of people when they see a need, and believe they can help.</p>
