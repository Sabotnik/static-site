<h2 id="phase-one-victims---survivors"><strong>PHASE ONE: Victims â€”-&gt; Survivors</strong></h2>

<p>Our staff in Tanzania worked with leaders in ten communities to identify the ten most traumatized survivors in each and created <strong>a two-year counseling program for them. All the women flourished and showed improved depression and anxiety scores on culturally appropriate testing</strong>. Their counselor, who also has a degree in community development, began teaching the 99 survivors about the principles of business.</p>

<h2 id="phase-two-survivors---entrepreneurs"><strong>PHASE TWO: Survivors â€”-&gt; Entrepreneurs</strong></h2>

<p>The women <strong>learned how to make tie-dye and batik style fabrics</strong>. They are paid per piece and sales go directly to program costs while providing economic security for these resilient women. <strong>The survivors now proudly call themselves</strong><em>entrepreneurs</em> <strong>and chose to name their enterprise VUMWE (voom-wee) Designs because in their Pare language, the word</strong><em>VUMWE</em> <strong>means</strong><em>UNITY</em><strong>.</strong></p>

<p><em>In 2019, Empower Tanzania became a member of the <a href="https://www.fairtradefederation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fair Trade Federation</a> and began growing this new social enterprise through sales, market research, and business and product development.</em></p>

<h2 id="phase-three-entrepreneurs--thriving-business-women">PHASE THREE: Entrepreneurs â€”â€“&gt; Thriving Business Women</h2>

<p>Empower Tanzania is seeking to raise $30,000 in 2021 as start-up capital to launch Vumwe Designs and help it become competitive in the international marketplace. Funds raised will be used to hire and train staff in Tanzania and support a three-year business development period. <strong>We believe that the program will become self-sufficient and the women in the Vumwe Designs collective will be trained and ready to take over the enterprise.</strong></p>
