<p>Haika Mnzava is a <a href="https://empowertz.org/programs/health/" target="_blank">Community Health Educator</a> who lives in a village in rural Tanzania called Vudee. She is one of 33 women educated and equipped to to teach her community about vital health information.</p>

<p>On this day, Haika was on her way to Hembua Primary School to present a lesson to the 12- and 13-year-olds in Class 5. She holds her portable projector in her hands and an excitement in her heart. <strong>“I enjoy the children so much! I love seeing them and teaching them about how to take care of their bodies and how to avoid disease.” </strong></p>

<p>Amidst the <a href="https://empowertz.org/covid-19response/" target="_blank">Covid-19 pandemic</a>, Haika’s efforts to educate are ongoing. She continues to distribute information in her ward about the virus and how people can protect themselves. <strong>In many ways, Empower Tanzania’s Community Health Educators have become front-line helpers in the midst of the pandemic. These women not only have the training, but also the long-established trust and respect of their communities.</strong> Because of this, Haika and the other 32 CHEs have been able to use their influence to save lives.</p>
