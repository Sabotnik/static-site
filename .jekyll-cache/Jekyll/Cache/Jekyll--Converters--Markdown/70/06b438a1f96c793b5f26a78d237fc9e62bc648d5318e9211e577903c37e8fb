<p>Sometimes, when we are moved to make a difference, we‚Äôre stopped by the idea that there is little we can do that will actually matter. We think, ‚ÄúReally? Who am I? What difference can my tiny contribution make?‚Äù</p>

<p>Well, Empower Tanzania board member Sheri Krumm is blogging today with a great example of the power of one individual and how little acts of love can add up to something that does indeed matter‚Ä¶in a very big way!</p>

<p><strong><em>From Sheri:</em></strong></p>

<p>I was so inspired watching people donate their birthdays on the Empower Tanzania Facebook page that I decided two weeks before my ¬†55th birthday that I wanted to do something similar.</p>

<p>With very little time to plan, we put together a Crowdrise Fundraiser (it took about an hour, tops) and sent invitations to a few friends to join us for an impromptu dinner to celebrate. Typically, when we gather with friends, we all bring something to share. But this time I told my friends to skip the potluck and just bring the cash they would have spent on meal prep and give it to Empower Tanzania‚Äîmy husband and I were happy to provide the food and wine.</p>

<p>Despite the short notice, nearly 40 of us gathered for a great night. We raised $650 on Crowdrise from a whole lot of very generous friends, and then finished with a party where we raised another $355. In total, we raised $1,005‚Ä¶and we had a ball doing it! It‚Äôs amazing what this will accomplish in Tanzania. The ¬†generosity of my friends ¬†will touch many, many lives. Not only did I have a wonderful time celebrating my 55th birthday with people I love, but we all took a small step toward making this world a better place. I‚Äôm glad I wasn‚Äôt stopped by the voice in my head questioning whether or not my actions would mean anything. What we did mattered.</p>
