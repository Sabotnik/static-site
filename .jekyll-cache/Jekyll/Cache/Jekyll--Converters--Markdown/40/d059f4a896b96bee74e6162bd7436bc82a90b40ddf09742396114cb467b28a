I"<p>Empower Tanzania supports projects to rehabilitate broken wells and to dig new ones improving health, keeping kids in school and women in the workforce, and enabling increasing amounts of agriculture. Diseases from unsafe water and lack of basic sanitation kill more people every year than all forms of violence, including war. Children are especially vulnerable, as their bodies arenâ€™t strong enough to fight diarrhea, dysentery, and other illnesses. With this foundation of information, our staff and volunteers held a weeklong training seminar to educate well mechanics throughout the Same District in best practices. With this training in hand, we have worked with local drilling companies to complete complicated well rehabilitations, implemented far-reaching distribution systems, and made use of the latest available technology, solar panels, and community engagement. In the last three years alone, tens of thousands have accessed clean water because of our efforts the communities of Hedaru, Katahe, Njiro, Pangaro, and Nadaruru.</p>
