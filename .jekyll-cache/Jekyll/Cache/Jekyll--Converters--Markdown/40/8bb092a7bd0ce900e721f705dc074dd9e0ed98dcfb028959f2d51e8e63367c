I"=<p>The <strong><em>P3 Impact Award</em></strong> was created by <em>Concordia.net</em>, the University of Virginia Darden School Institute for Business in Society, and the U.S. Department of State’s Office of Global Partnerships to recognize and honor leading public-private partnerships (P3s) that improve communities and the world. </p>

<p>While announcing this year’s winner, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, Keith Krach, remarked that <em>“by using collaborative models and leveraging the strengths of public, private, and civil society partners, the finalists are ensuring the impact they are having today will continue to be sustainable and scalable for the next generation of leaders and innovators.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Empower Tanzania is proud to say we were one of the semi-finalists in the most recent award cycle’s field of entries with our Sex Education initiative in the Secondary Schools located in the Pare Region of Tanzania. </strong></p>

<p>We were recognized for being bold enough to start this very important conversation, for product and implementation innovation, and for involving leaders from across the region to enhance the longer-term benefits for the Tanzanian society as a whole. </p>

<p>Without your financial support, this would not have been possible. Together we do make a difference! Thank you!</p>
