      Fit Rx suggests that clients take time to read the profiles of fitness trainers providing services at Fit Rx. Individual preferences and training styles are factors that can and will dictate who YOU choose to train with, so we at Fit Rx suggest you take time to get to know who you will be working with.
    </p>
    <p>
      All trainers are independent contractors and are solely responsible for meeting the criteria and expectations for fitness training at Fit Rx.  Each trainer is also expected to manage client schedules and activity. If there is a need to adjust your training schedule and availability, you should make this clear with your trainer.
