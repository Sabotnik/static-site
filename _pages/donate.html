  <p>
    <strong>Thanks to the generosity of our donors,</strong> Empower Tanzania is able to empower the people of rural Tanzania. Our donors give hope to those who struggle every day due to the lack of basic health care, education, and economic development. Your weekly, monthly, annual, or one-time donation provides us with the support we
    depend on.

      In Swahili, “wezesha” means “to empower” or “enable” and it’s what we believe in. You, too, can join this life-giving work by empowering us to effectively assist those who need it most. By joining the Wezesha Circle, you can commit to monthly giving
      that will tremendously enhance the work that we’re able to do. Your support will impact generations of people.
