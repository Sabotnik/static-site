            The people we serve in rural Tanzania already live without a safety
            net or access to adequate healthcare. <b>Throughout the entire country of 60
            million people there are less than 50 ICU beds and less than 30 ventilators.</b> In
            the Kilimanjaro Region, where we serve, there is a total of 14 ICU beds and 4
            ventilators.
        </p>
        <p>
            The warnings from experts about the possible devastation throughout Africa has
            cemented our belief that it’s more important than ever to care of one another. We all
            share the same world, and we’re all in this together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our team in Tanzania is moving forward with optimism and trust. We are
            determined to help. If you are able, please join us as we jump to action.
