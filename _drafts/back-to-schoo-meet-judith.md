*This post was prepared i by Education Program Director, Yoeza Mnzava:*

Judith is staying with her grandmother at Kiwanja, which is close to SAME TOWN (Empower Tanzania headquarters). Judith was orphaned at a young age and circumstances become even tougher for her when her grandmother passed away. **She failed even to go to school because she had no school uniform or stationeries for schooling.**

Judith was under constant pressure from her fellow peer group to be married. For a girl raised in a male dominated society, this should been the end. But not for Judith.

Judith met Teacher Bertha from MAJENGO PRIMARY SCHOOL, she explained what she faced. Teacher Bertha connected her to Empower Tanzania. It was a turning point to Judith simply because she was assisted by Same Learning Center (SLC) with all of her school expenses: school uniform, stationeries, school lunch and attending lessons at school. Judith also started to attend lessons at the SLC every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. She proves herself to be a superstar for her strength to move forward despite her circumstances.

From a life overcoming challenges, Judith believes that Empower Tanzania— through the Same Learning Program—changed her life completely. As Judith says, "Life is a struggle without education; it’s had to survive without it."

Judith wants to be a doctor because her grandmother died of thorax cancer two years ago and during that time they had not even a single coin to help her be cured. In particular, Judith wants to serve others who are low privileged.
