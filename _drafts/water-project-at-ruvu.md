Although the main problem with the existing Ruvu water source was the broken down windmill, we found many other damaged pieces to the system after a survey was done by our technicians and the water engineer. Sander and Joseph did a super job of re-engineering the system so that the community gets water where they need it, and to keep the scope of the work under control.&nbsp;

We are abandoning the original borehole tanks and will increase the tank capacity at the nearby school by adding two new tanks for a total of five. The existing tank stand will need to be expanded to accommodate five tanks. The tanks will be fitted with connectors and floats. Concrete chamber boxes will be repaired. New 1.5" HDPE water pipes will be installed from the borehole to the five tanks. Miscellaneous parts for the new distribution pipe system are: 4 gate valves, water meter, non return valve (check valve), coupling couplings, 3/4" pipes with couplings and connectors.

As typical, the community will help store and secure all materials. They will dig all trenches that are needed for the pipes. Joseph tells me that the local government is well organized and there is a good water committee.

Let me know if you need more information.
