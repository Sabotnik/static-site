## **PHASE ONE: Victims ----&gt; Survivors**

Empower Tanzania staff in Tanzania worked with leaders in ten communities to identify the ten most traumatized survivors in each and created **a two-year counseling program for them. All the women flourished and showed improved depression and anxiety scores on culturally appropriate testing**. Their counselor, who also has a degree in community development, began teaching the 99 survivors about the principles of business.

## **PHASE TWO: Survivors ----&gt; Entrepreneurs**

The women **learned how to make tie-dye and batik style fabrics**. They are paid per piece and sales go directly to program costs while providing economic security for these resilient women. **The survivors now proudly call themselves***entrepreneurs* **and chose to name their enterprise VUMWE (voom-wee) Designs because in their Pare language, the word***VUMWE* **means***UNITY***.**

In 2019, Empower Tanzania became a member of the [Fair Trade Federation](https://www.fairtradefederation.org/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and began growing this new social enterprise through sales, market research, and business and product development.

## PHASE THREE: Entrepreneurs -----&gt; Thriving Business Women

Empower Tanzania is seeking to raise $30,000 in 2021 as start-up capital to launch Vumwe Designs and help it become competitive in the international marketplace. Funds raised will be used to hire and train staff in Tanzania and support a three-year business development period. **We believe that the program will become self-sufficient and the women in the Vumwe Designs collective will be trained and ready to take over the enterprise.**
