Empower Tanzania supports projects to rehabilitate broken wells and to dig new ones improving health and enabling increasing amounts of agriculture. It is estimated that 1 in 7 people worldwide live without access to clean water. Diseases from unsafe water and lack of basic sanitation kill more people every year than all forms of violence, including war. Children are especially vulnerable, as their bodies arenâ€™t strong enough to fight diarrhea, dysentery, and other illnesses. Ninety percent of the 30,000 deaths that occur every week from unsafe water and unhygienic living conditions are in children under five years old. Thanks to some very generous donations in 2014, Phase 1 of the Katahe Water Project is fully funded and about to begin. This is a big victory for the people of this small Maasai village in northeastern Tanzania. This community currently depends on the nearby Pangani River, which is notorious for crocodiles and rock pythons, both capable of attacking children as they collect water and eating unsuspecting goats as they drink. To the people who live and raise animals in this dry desert, the well will make an enormous difference. Digging began this spring.
