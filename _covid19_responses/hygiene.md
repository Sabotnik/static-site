title: Promote Hand-Washing & Hygiene
---
Because of our completed water projects over the past decade—rehabilitating broken-down wells, digging new wells, training well mechanics, and empowering communities with WASH training and education—thousands of people in rural Tanzania have access clean water, which is essential to hygiene and health. We continue to promote hand-washing and crucial hygiene measures during this time.
