title: Public Health Messaging
---
In early April, we addressed crucial public health messaging by distributing 50,000 flyers with accurate COVID-19 information to government offices, healthcare facilities, public markets, motorcycle taxi stands, bus stops, community organizations, churches, mosques, businesses, and other prominent locations throughout the Same District. They were distributed by our 33 Community Health Educators (who wore masks and practiced physical distancing and sanitation measures) in each of the 31 wards where they live so the documents could obtain widespread exposure to the population. This information was also distributed electronically on social media channels and via WhatsApp.
