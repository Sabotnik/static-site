title: Women First-Responders
---
Because of past education and extensive training in matters of preventative health and basic heath care, we have a team of more than 60 Community Healthcare Workers, Community Health Educators, and Birth Attendants who are on the frontlines of our response to this virus. The women trained yesterday are first-responders today.
