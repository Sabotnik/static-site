# Master repository for Jekyll static sites

**_Each site has it's own branch, use 'master' branch to make changes to all sites and then pull the master changes into each site branch._**

*Requires a pull request for all submissions to 'master' branch - create a separate branch and then a pull request to merge with master*

Built on Jekyll 3.8.5, Ruby 2.5.6
### Due to issues with precompiling Bootstrap 4 and being able to override the variables, just create CSS/Sass from Flexbox and best practices.
