#Master repository for Jekyll static sites

Requires a pull request for all submissions to 'master' branch - this is a precaution to avoid issues with deleting/messing up the purpose of the repository.

##Built on Jekyll 3.8.5, Ruby 2.5.6
###Due to issues with precompiling Bootstrap 4 and being able to override the variables, just create CSS/Sass from Flexbox and best practices.
