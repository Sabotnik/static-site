title: Reproductive Health and Relationships Program
---
The exceptionally high pregnancy rate of schoolgirls in the rural communities of Same District has drawn concern from government, religious, and community organizations. Empower Tanzania has been asked to help address this problem and its attendant risks of sexually transmitted diseases and the onset of sexual activity. Reproductive health education has been demonstrated in multiple research studies to reduce teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, as well as delay the age of onset of sexual activity. In 2018, a pilot program of reproductive health and relationships education was initiated for over 11,000 primary and secondary school students in 19 schools in and around Same, Tanzania. Videos in Swahili on puberty, menstrual periods, reproductive health, and relationships were produced and a curriculum and lesson plans developed for the program. Thirty-eight teachers were trained in the curriculum during a four-day course in September of 2018 and, subsequently, 90 more were trained in their schools. This adds up to a ratio of 1 teacher per 100 students in the Same District will now teach course content during the 2019 school year in three to four 40-minute sessions per month.
