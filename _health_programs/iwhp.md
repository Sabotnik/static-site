title: Improving Women's Health Program
---
The Improving Womenâ€™s Health Program began in 2013 and trained 33 women as Community Health Educators (CHEs), each serving one ward of Same District (population 269,000). The CHEs use interactive presentations as well as educational videos in Swahili to provide information on such basic topics as hand washing, purifying water, mosquito nets use to prevent malaria, HIV/AIDS and family planning. Each CHE conducts at least 12 meetings per month and their impact is remarkable! As of December of 2018, the CHEs have done 23,549 presentations and presented individual topics to 1,056,750 signed attendees in Same District since the program began! District-wide surveys have demonstrated the effectiveness of the presentations in improved health topic knowledge and attitude change. In fact, preliminary government health data found lower rates of malaria, diarrheal diseases, intestinal parasites, and acute respiratory infection in Same District compared with neighboring control districts. Each CHE was provided a sturdy bicycle and helmet in 2018 to further expand their reach.
