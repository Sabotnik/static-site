The Improving Women’s Health Program (IWHP) began in 2012 and has trained 33 women as Community Health Educators (CHEs), each serving one ward of the Same District (population 269,000). The CHEs use interactive presentations as well as educational videos in Swahili to provide information on such basic topics as hand washing, purifying water, and mosquito nets use to prevent malaria. Each CHE conducts 12 meetings per month with attendance now averaging over 17,000 people per month. In total, over 700,000 people have attended over 16,000 meetings carried out through the program. The impact of these women is amazing! District wide surveys have demonstrated the effectiveness of the presentations in improved health topic knowledge and attitude change. In fact, preliminary government health data found lower rates of malaria, diarrheal diseases, intestinal parasites and acute respiratory infection in Same District compared with neighboring control districts. (Read the IWHP Operation Narrative for 2016 by clicking HERE.)
