Palliative Care (also called “end-of-life” care) began in 2007 with funding from the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and trained 240 Community Health Workers from 24 villages in the delivery of palliative care services to terminally ill people in their villages. Over time the program added training in home-based care. Empower Tanzania completed its involvement in the program in 2015, but a limited version continues with the support of the Tanzanian Red Cross and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
